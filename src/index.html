<h2>1405 E 7th St</h2>

<p>Vintage Heart Coffee is a locally owned coffeehome located at 1405 East 7th Street.
here at Vintage Heart, we believe a good cup of coffee partnered with a bit of witty
banter make the world spin a little slower and, most certainly, more enjoyable.</p>

<p><img src="/static/img/thirdcoast_bag.png" width="150" alt="Third Coast Coffee" /> We are proud
to brew the fair trade coffees and espresso from fellow locals Third Coast Roasting Company. Those
guys are great. They never sleep and choose to wear entire outfits out of denim, what's not to
love.</p>

<p>Russel's Bakery graces us with their fine pastries, Red Rabbit Cooperative Bakery provides
crave-worthy vegan donuts, muffins, and brownies (oh my!), and with house-made syrups (did someone
say lavender?), we have your coffee fix covered.</p>

<p>We have free wi-fi and copious amounts of plugs so pull up a chair and get comfy.  Our baristas
are highly skilled and self-declared coffee nerds. They will also dominate you in scrabble.</p>

<p>We hope to hand you your 'usual' soon. Welcome to Vintage Heart.</p>
