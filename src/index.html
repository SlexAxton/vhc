  <p>We are proud to brew the <em>fair trade coffees and espresso</em> from fellow locals
  <a href="http://www.thirdcoastcoffee.com/">Third Coast Roasting Company</a>. Those guys are
  great. They never sleep and choose to wear entire outfits out of denim, what's not to love?</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.russellsbakery.com/">Russel's Bakery</a> graces us with their fine
  pastries, <a href="http://www.redrabbitbakery.com/">Red Rabbit Cooperative Bakery</a> provides
  crave-worthy vegan donuts, muffins, and brownies (oh my!), and with house-made syrups (did
  someone say <span style"color:lavender;">lavender</span>?), we have your coffee fix covered.</a>

  <p>We have <strong>free wi-fi</strong> and copious amounts of plugs so pull up a chair and get
  comfy. Our baristas are highly skilled and self-declared coffee nerds. They will also dominate
  you in scrabble.</p>

  <p>We hope to hand you your 'usual' soon. <strong>Welcome to Vintage Heart</strong>.</p>
