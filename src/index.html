<h2>7am - 8pm</h2>
<h2>1405 E 7th St</h2>

<p>vintage heart coffee is a locally owned coffeehome located at 1405 East 7th Street.
here at vintage heart, we believe a good cup of coffee partnered with a bit of witty
banter make the world spin a little slower and, most certainly, more enjoyable.</p>

<p>we are proud to brew the fair trade coffees and espresso from fellow locals Third Coast
Roasting Company.  those guys are great. they never sleep and choose to wear entire outfits
out of denim, what's not to love.</p>

<p>russel's bakery graces us with their fine pastries, red
rabbit cooperative bakery provides crave-worthy vegan donuts, muffins, and brownies (oh my!),
and with house-made syrups (did someone say lavender?), we have your coffee fix covered.</p>

<p>we have free wi-fi and copious amounts of plugs so pull up a chair and get comfy.  our baristas
are highly skilled and self-declared coffee nerds.  they will also dominate you in scrabble.</p>

<p>we hope to hand you your 'usual' soon. welcome to vintage heart.</p>
